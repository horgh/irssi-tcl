Eggdrop scripts can be converted to run in Irssi with some minor modifications.
Look at the included scripts. Many of these also have eggdrop versions on my
github in the eggdrop-scripts project.

a. Modifications for bind functions (e.g. pub/pubm calls):
  1. Remove hand function argument in bind proc

  2. Add server argument as first function argument in bind proc
    e.g. proc someproc {nick uhost hand chan argv} { .. }
      -> proc someproc {server nick uhost chan argv} { .. }

  3. Alter all putserv/puthelp calls to have $server as their first argument
    e.g. putserv "PRIVMSG $chan :Hello there"
      -> putserv $server "PRIVMSG $chan :Hello there"

    NOTE: putserv will not show output in Irssi. It is better to replace putserv
    with putchan $server $chan "$text" which will (if a public message...)

  4. Possible gotcha of the above: any calls that are not in the procs that
     are bound directly which use putserv will require an added argument
     e.g. proc do_something {chan text} {
         putserv "PRIVMSG $chan :$text"
       }
    -> proc do_something {server chan text} {
         putserv $server "PRIVMSG $chan :text"
       }

The script ./utils/eggdrop_convert.tcl can be used for cases 1-3 (hopefully)
But it does not deal with putserv to putchan. See the script for more info.

The script ./utils/eggdrop_convert_putchan.tcl can be used to convert some
cases of putserv to putchan. See the script for more info.
 
b. Change [channel get $channel value] to
   [str_in_settings_str value $channel]
   to replace +enable'd values for channels with lists of channels via /set

c. Change 'setudef flag <value>' to instead use 'settings_add_str "value" ""' or
   some other /settings type. Combine with b) to use.

d. Change "bind type flag trigger function"
   e.g. "bind pub -|- !trigger function" to, for instance,
   "signal_add msg_pub trigger function"

f. For non-blocking scripts you must use callback functions and use Tcl's
   event support. For the http:: package, this means using the -command flag
	 with http::geturl.
